##### 1. Ensure Anaconda is installed  
If you don't have Anaconda installed, download it from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).

##### 2. Navigate to the CAFE directory (./CAFE/)

- **Ensure you are in the correct directory where you will find the following files: bin folder, cafe.py, pixi.toml, cafe.yaml etc.**
- If unsure, open your terminal app (or Anaconda Powershell) and navigate to the folder containing the `cafe.py` file by typing:
```bash
cd ./path/to/CAFE
```

##### 3. Create a predefined conda environment  
```bash
conda env create -f cafe.yaml
```
This will automatically create a new environment called `cafe` and install all required packages.

##### 4. Activate the conda environment  
Run this command to activate the Conda environment
```bash
conda activate cafe
```
<Aside type='caution' title='Note'>   
If you already have a `cafe` environment from a previous version, remove it first by deactivating the environment and running:
```bash
conda env remove -n cafe -y
```
Then, start from step 3 to set up a fresh environment.
