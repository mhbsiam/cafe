CAFE is an open-source, free, no-code, web-app platform for high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry data (SFCM) analysis. CAFE has been developed in Python and it can run seamlessly on regular computers operating on either Windows or macOS/Linux. The application will allow the analysis and visualization of SFCM data to produce high-resolution publication-ready figures that support reproducible research of immune cell populations.
<Aside type="note" title="Update">
  CAFE is published in Bioinformatics
